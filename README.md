# Turtle Art Project

This project uses Python's `turtle` and `colorsys` libraries to create a colorful spiral art design. The design is drawn using the turtle graphics module with a dynamic color gradient that changes based on the drawing loop.

## Features

- **Colorful Gradient**: Uses HSV color space to generate a smooth gradient of colors.
- **Spiral Design**: The turtle moves in a spiral pattern, creating an intricate design.
- **Customizable Parameters**: You can adjust the size, number of loops, and colors to create unique patterns.

## Libraries Used

- `turtle`: A Python library for creating simple drawings and graphics.
- `colorsys`: A module that provides functions for converting between different color spaces (used to generate the color gradient).

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If you don't, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Create a new Python file and paste the code into it.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python main.py
